Project Title: Pi and Lagrangian Points

Summary:
Power your spacecraft out of the solar system by using the stability of Lagrange Points to aid your 
flight and use them as checkpoints to leave the pull of the Sun.
Players start at Mercury and use the arrow keys (or game controllers) to power spacecraft against the 
gravity of the sun and the respective planets to reach the Lagrange points of the successive planets 
and use them as checkpoints on the journey outside the solar system. After passing all 8 planets, 
players finish the game. If players fall into the sun or crash into planets, they lose. Fuel points 
are tallied and the player who uses the smallest amount of fuel wins the game. 

Players can refine their strategy and timing to use less fuel, as the planets orbit the sun at 
different rates, creating many opportunities to use gravity assists to power the craft out of 
the solar system. 

Alternately, simpler levels could be created with fewer planets or simpler conditions. 


Supplies:
-Pi
-Monitor
-Keyboard (or Game Controller)
