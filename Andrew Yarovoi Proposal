                                                Proposed Project
    I propose that we make a Maze Runner 3 game. This more advanced version of Maze Runner 2 game will be similar to the calculator game that I made but because it will be made using Raspberry Pi, it will be faster and will have more features.  The original Maze Runner 2 game had teleporters, control shuffler, keys, locks, and even fake objects. With Pithon programming, this game will probably be finished quicker and have more features than the one I was able to create with a calculator. Though I have never programmed in Pithon before, I am sure that this game can be accomplished. Some new features that could be added to this game are levers, trap doors, buttons, and other things that will make this game better than any other maze game ever created.
