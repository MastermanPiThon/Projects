Name: Brandon Dunbar
Proposal

Summary: I want to do a game similar to asteroid where the user attempts
         to shoot the enemies for points. I want to ship to be able to 
         spin and shoot as well as move. There will be a series of levels 
         based on either the number of enemies defeated or the score they
         achieve.

Materials:
  - Raspberry Pi
  - Monitor
  - Game Controller(s)
  - Sprites for ship and enemies
  - Text Display for score, enemy count, etc.
  - Group of 3+ people
