Summary: 
My project would be a computer game involving a character that goes through a series of levels. Each level would involve a different situation and require the character to get across the screen, going against obstacles, mazes, and "enemies". If you are touched by an enemy, you have to restart the level. The levels would all be interconnected by a theme, like some sort of quest with a reward at the end. Snazzy graphics and keyboard only. 

Materials: 
-Raspberry Pi 
-Keyboard
-Creativity!
