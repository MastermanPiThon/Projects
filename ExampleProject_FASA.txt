Project Name: Flying Atomic Space Apes

Summary:
A botched supernova mutated normal earth apes into FYLYING ATOMIC SPACE APES!!!  
If that wasn't bad enough they are angry.  The only thing that will appease them 
are RADIOACTIVE BANANAS.  Feed the FLYING ATOMIC SPACE APES!!! a stream of RADIOACTIVE BANANAS 
untill they are too laden with RADIOACTIVE BANANAS to fly.  

The format of this game will be a 2D side view of a horizon with a RADIOACTIVE BANANA tank that can move from left 
to right on the bottom of the screen.  FLYING ATOMIC SPACE APES!!! will fly across the sky shooting cosmic rays 
which must be avoided.  Once overladen with RADIOACTIVE BANANAS a FLYING ATOMIC SPACE APE!!! will fall to the ground 
as a harmless atomic space ape and disappear.  The game is lost when a FLYING ATOMIC SPACE APE!!! reaches the ground.  
The game is won when all FLYING SPACE APES!! have been turned into harmless atomic space apes.  No score will be kept.

The keyboard will be used for control.  Space fires RADIOACTIVE BANANAs.  Left and right arrows move the 
RADIOACTIVE BANANA tank across the screen.
