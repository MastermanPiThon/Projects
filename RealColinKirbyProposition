PiTHON Programming Goal
Colin Kirby

	Once upon a time, there was a boy named Colin. He was interested in programming, and decided to join robotics and the PiTHON enrichment course. I enjoy playing games so my ultimate goal would be to design a game with graphics. I know Iâ€™m not at the point where I can code an advanced game, or even a simple game.  But through this course I hope to learn the basics of graphical, mathematical, and other fun aspects of programing. I hope that I can progress from simple math programs, to simple games like hangman, and eventually a more unique game that requires a time commitment and usage of all the skills I have learned in this course. A game that would interest me to make at this point would be a simple 8 bit game like the old pokemons. Designing the landscape and adventure aspect of the game would be fun. Working with others to accomplish the goal of a full adventure game that requires landscape design, a dialogue script, and items and quests you can pick up along the way. I know this is a long way away from where i am at, bu by the end of the year, the knowledge I have learned and previously known, I think with the help of others I can make this game that I strive for. I will call the game galactanoid. The story of a galactic conquistador, from the planet of Barcelona (Not the city). He will conquer each planet and eventually reach his goal of conquering Earth.
