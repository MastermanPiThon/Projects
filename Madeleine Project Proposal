I would like make a game similar to Doodle Jump in which a person could hold a screen attached to a gyroscope and depending on how they tilt the screen the character on the screen moves left or right. The character would fall and start over if they did not move their character onto platforms as they move by which could be randomly created. The character keeps playing until they fall. I would use pygame, a screen, and a gyroscope.
