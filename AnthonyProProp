MATHDRAGON!
by Anthony Rolland

I would like to make a game like type shark, but instead of sharks they would be fireballs launched by a huge dragon. The
words on these fireballs would be randomly generated math problems. After defending from fireballs, the knight (the player
) would have to approach the dragon and have to complete math problems to cause damage to the dragon. Once the dragon is
defeated a victory cutscene would be played. It would be called "Slay the Dragon". When you recieve damage the board shocks
you.

It would be a side scroller with the knight always moving to the right. 8 bit graphics.
