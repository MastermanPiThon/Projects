I want to make an 8 level game, each level having 2 parts.
First part is grouping 3 or more of the same symbol to get 
points on the board. After a certain amount of time another
row would be added. The goal of this part is to reach the target
amount of points before time runs out. The second part would
be a matching game, solely for bonus points. Over the course of
8 levels, either the amount of points would get higher, or time would
get shorter.

There might be a story attached to this, but I have no idea what
it would be about as this point.

Supplies:
Mouse
Computer
Raspberry Pi
