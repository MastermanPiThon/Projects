Summary: Mr. Nova was drinking his cup of Earl Grey Tea when suddenly, 
         the evil antagonist, the Earl King, stole his lifetime supply
         of Earl Grey Tea! What an abomination! Mr. Nova must go on an
         adventure to save his precious tea! Follow him as he treks
         through the Earl King's mansion and recover bags of tea he
         dropped and stop this madness. 

         I plan to program a game that involves a sprite 
         going through a series of levels of increasing 
         difficulty, where the levels involve puzzles that 
         players must solve in order to advance to the next
         level
