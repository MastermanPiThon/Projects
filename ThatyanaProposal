Summary: I plan to program a game that involves the 
         player making choices. Basically a text based
         game. Based on what the player decides, different
         situations happen. My trouble might be the time
         it will take to go through many different combinations
         of actions and endings. There will also be some
         combat with random characters in the story. It'll
         revert from a first person perspective to a third
         person perspective where the player can see him/herself
         fighting with the character. This should involve lives
         or the ability to have an inventory or weapons. 
         There will also be other minigames if this goes that far
         such as puzzles the player has to solve in order to continue
         a certain point/
