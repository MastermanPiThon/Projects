Name: Emmett Neyman
Project Name: Semi-Autonomous Recon Bot

Description: This bot does everything. Well, almost everything. It does some stuff. 
My vision is to have a robot that uses an ultrasonic range sensor to explore its surroundings. 
Then, the robot will send live video footage back to a computer. Programming could give the robot a 
memory so it would never repeat its path. My end goal is for it to be able to complete a maze. 
Other sensors could be used to gather more accurate data about its surroundings and to provide better 
information to the on-board controller. If possible, wireless controlling would be awesome. 

Materials:
  - Rasperry Pi or Arduino (some kind of micro-controller)
  - i-racer (or 4 motors + necessary electronics)
  - 1-2 ultrasonic range sensors
  - Wireless keyboard (if we add wireless functionality)
  - Pi Camera
  - Breadboard and other electronics
