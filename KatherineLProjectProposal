Summary: 
My project idea is to make an amped-up version of Tetris for the Raspberry Pi. Instead of getting just a row of one color, players could have the option of playing “Poker Tetris” (need to get a row of Kings or a Royal Flush, etc) or “Math Tetris” (get some pattern of numbers). The game controller would be used to maneuver the falling pieces. 

Materials:
Game Controller 
Raspberry Pi
Pictures/clip art of Card Faces (and other pictures that may be necessary)
